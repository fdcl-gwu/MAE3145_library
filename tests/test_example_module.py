"""Testing module for example_module.py

This module will hold many tests to ensure that our code is actually doing what
it is supposed to do. Since testing is so critical we have a seperate place to
define these tests. In addition, we should continually test as we're always
going to be changing/improving our code. As a result, all of our testing should
be as automatic and simple as possible.
